## What Lovable manages

Rules outside this block are the project's own. Change the pieces below in
Lovable, not by hand. With the [Lovable MCP](https://mcp.lovable.dev)
connected, `send_message` asks Lovable to do it; otherwise ask the user to
use the editor.

- **Database.** Do not add or edit `supabase/migrations/` or `drizzle/`.
  Ask Lovable to change the schema.
- **Generated files.** Do not edit a file whose header says it is automatically
  generated.
- **AI gateway.** Keep model calls on Lovable's gateway, and keep
  `LOVABLE_API_KEY` out of browser code.
- **Connectors.** Lovable provides native connectors. `list_connectors` shows
  which are enabled; `add_connector` only returns the dashboard link. When a
  connector is enabled, calls go through the connector gateway and need
  `LOVABLE_API_KEY`. When Lovable does not provide one, users can bring their
  own key and store it in Secrets.
- **Secrets.** Lovable manages them. Do not put secret values in the repo.

## Project rules

- The NEXORIA app is one page at `/` (`src/routes/index.tsx` renders `src/components/NexoriaApp.tsx`); its screens switch with React state, not routes, because it was imported from a single-page Vite app and kept as-is.
- Theme and language preferences load from localStorage only after hydration (in `PreferencesProvider` effects), because the page is server-rendered and storage reads during render cause mismatches.
- Accounts sign in with a username mapped to a synthetic internal email, so email auto-confirm must stay on and email-based password reset is not available.
- Avatar items a player equips are saved on their own `profiles` row and changed only through a narrow security-definer RPC (e.g. `set_equipped_shirt`), because profiles has no general update policy and usernames/account numbers must stay read-only.
- Avatar 3D items (like hair) are built from CSS 3D pieces (`CharacterBlock` boxes, `CharacterSpike` pyramids) inside the existing CSS character viewer, not three.js, so they match and rotate with the imported character renderer.
- Catalog purchases go through the security-definer `purchase_item` RPC, which reads the price from the database `catalog_price` function, deducts `profiles.nexos` and adds an `inventory_items` row; the client price list in `src/lib/avatar.ts` is display-only and must be kept in sync with `catalog_price`, and equip RPCs for sold items require ownership.
- Admin powers come from the `user_roles` table (checked with `has_role`); every admin command is a security-definer RPC that re-checks `has_role` (account deletion is a `requireSupabaseAuth` server function using the admin client), because the floating Admin panel only hides UI and must not be the security boundary.
- Home-screen games live in the `games` table (private ones visible only to admins); icon and colour keys map to Lucide icons and gradient classes in `src/lib/games.ts`, because Tailwind classes must stay literal in source.
